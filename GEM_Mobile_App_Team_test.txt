My name is Michael Wolf.  My github username is MichaelRWolf.  I am excited to work with AIT and GEM to make an app that will help teams assess their team skills and play a game to celebrate their growth and focus on the next skill they want to improve.  Here is my favorite poem:

   Roses are red.
   Violets are blue.
   Some poems rhyme.
   This one doesn't.
